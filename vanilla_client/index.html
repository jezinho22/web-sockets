      <h1>The Prisoner Dilemma</h1>
      <h3>What do snitches get?</h3>
      <div class="text">You and a fellow criminal gang member have been arrested. The police don't have enough evidence to convict on the principal charge. But they can definitely get you both a year in prison on a lesser charge.
        <br></br>You are in solitary, but can get messages to each other.
        <br></br> The police are offering a bargain: if you testify against your partner, you will go free while your partner will get three years in prison on the main charge. 
        <br></br>But there is a catch ... If you both testify against each other, you will both get two years. 
        <br></br>You have both been offered the same deal. How can you minimise your sentence?
